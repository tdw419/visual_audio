"""GH-23: Picolibc/Newlib Full Port — bake the libc-mode Syscall ABI v2
kernel with the transpiled C (libc-linked) program as the USER task,
a REAL sys_brk tile, and a 4-word-window sys_write tile in the GH-18
tile rect (syscall table slots lit ONLY by admission/stamping — the
same door GH-21 uses).

libc ABI (engine facts, see tests/test_gh23_libc_runtime.py header):
  - The engine marshals a7/a0/a1 into SYS_N/SYS_A0/SYS_A1 (glyph_isa_v2
    SYSCALL branch). a2 is NOT marshaled, so sys_write's length rides
    the tile contract: the gate's libc buffers exactly 16 bytes (4
    words) per write(1, buf, 16) and the tile copies a FIXED 4-word
    stdout window.
  - sys_brk: the libc is a bump allocator over the brk. The brk value
    lives IN-IMAGE at GH23_BRK (word 723) — the tile reads it, adds the
    delta from SYS_A0, stores it back, and returns the OLD break in
    SYS_A0 (sbrk semantics; the engine's SYSRET delivers SYS_A0 into
    the task's a0). GH-21 left this slot a verdict-0 stub; GH-23 is the
    upgrade (the test leg pins mem[723] advancing by the deltas).
  - The unsigned idx mask ((n-6) & 15) aliases the POSIX numbers onto
    the 16 table slots:
      214 (brk) -> 1568       93 (exit) -> 1575      64 (write) -> 1578
    (GH-23 stamps exactly these three — the gate fixture only calls
    write/exit/brk. read/openat/close remain dark: an unlit slot traps
    cleanly to unknown, leg 4.)
  - The bake-time tile sources are IR-verified (ir_pixel_words) exactly
    like every ingest() candidate.

    """BK-24 STREAMING sys_write tile: append the 4 buf words at the
    cursor (word 724) into the stream ring [768, 832), advance the cursor,
    and mirror the 4 words into the legacy window 718..721 (so the
    BK-11-era window contract stays readable — the live guard in
    tests/test_bk11_coreutils.py never weakened).

    Why APPEND, and why no length/loop: (a) the engine marshals only
    a7/a0/a1 — a2 (length) never reaches the tile, so the copied span is
    fixed at 4 words (the libc's flush contract sizes its buffer to the
    span); (b) stamped-tile control flow is avoided by design — the tile
    text is unrolled straight-line code, IR-verified and relocated with
    the same machinery as GH-23's other tiles (branch-free needs no
    JZ/JMP relocation, which removes a whole class of stamped-branch
    defects — receipt dbg_gh21_green9..13 lineage). 64 bytes/stream is
    bounded by the ring size, not the tile size (the ring holds 64 words;
    the item-18 GREEN leg writes 64 bytes in ONE flush; multiple flushes
    append until saturation).

    Tile shape (59 instructions + the 2-instr KJMP home; rect reserve
    doubled 48 -> 96 cells in the splice below — write 59 + exit 7 +
    brk 10 = 76 cells):
      r6  = buf word address (SYS_A1 byte addr >> 2)
      r7..r10 = the 4 buf words
      r11 = cursor (LD mem[724]); the tile SATURATES (BK-54): when the
            cursor == ring end 832 the frame is DROPPED, the loud-drop
            counter (word 725) increments, and the cursor clamps at 832.
            Excess frame words are diverted to dead sink 726..729 (past 832
            is untouched, preserving canaries).
            Otherwise it appends w0..w3 at ring[cursor..cursor+3] and
            stores cursor+4 back to 724 (leaving drop counter at 0).
      The legacy window 718..721 receives w0..w3 on BOTH paths (the
      mirror shows the stream tail, refused frames included).
      BK-54 (2026-10-01): 100% branchless saturation. Eliminates stamped
      branch displacement/relocation traps completely while providing
      mathematically exact clamp and loud-drop counting.

    Same link contract as GH-21/23 tiles: buf address rides SYS_A1

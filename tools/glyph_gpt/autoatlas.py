"""autoatlas.py — GH-12 capstone: the loop-closure piece.

The kernel requests a capability it lacks (routine-name resolution miss);
a local model drafts the glyph assembly; the oracle proves correctness
word-exactly; RoutineAtlas.register() double-gates it; the verified tile
is injected into the resident kernel through the GH-9 mailbox (the GH-11
drive() session plays the loader role) and re-dispatched. The admitted
program's pixels land in the live image, so the tile persists offline —
the same persistence model as GH-8b/GH-9.

FROZEN CONTRACT (2026-09-09, signed off in-session):
  detect:   launcher resolves routine by name -> miss (KeyError path)
  invoke:   escalate(name + contract_spec, expect_registers, input_registers)
            but ONLY if the name's family is on the escalatable whitelist
            — a corrupted mailbox payload name can NEVER trip the model.
  success:  verified text -> RoutineAtlas.register() -> mailbox inject ->
            kernel re-dispatch; result word-exact vs the oracle.
  failure:  E_ATLAS_UNVERIFIED after N attempts (full candidate history in
            the receipt) or E_ATLAS_FAMILY (whitelist, zero model calls).
            HARD-FAIL: no automatic frontier fallback, ever.
